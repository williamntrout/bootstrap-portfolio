                            <ul>Though I currently reside in the midwest, I am far from a Kansas City native. As a
                                matter of
                                fact, though I call Seattle my home, I can hardly be called a "native" of any one place.
                                I come from a military family that moved around the globe on a fairly regular basis.
                            </ul>
                            <ul>Many people think I am exaggerating about the number of times I have moved when the
                                first
                                here me say it. However, once they hear teh details, they quickly put me in the "nomad"
                                category. I personally have never lived in a residence longer than two years my entire
                                life. If we are being honest, I cannot ever count the number of addresses I have had.
                                Even when did stay in one place for any period of time, we moved houses almost annually.
                            </ul>
                            <ul>This all seemed natural to me as I come from a family with a long military tradition. In
                                fact my son, 1LT WIlliam Trout, is a sixth generation soldier in the US Army. We often
                                make the joke that the Army is our family business. At one point my father, his sister,
                                her daughter, my sister, and myself were all serving at the same time.
                            </ul>
                            <ul>Luckily this type of life experience has molded me into a person who is flexible,
                                dedicated, adaptive, and open to change. I neither run from change or shy away from
                                adversity regardless of situation. Hence the reason I am participating in this program.
                                Technology, and the internet in particular, has cost me several jobs over the years. I
                                finally just decided to get on top of that wave rather than have it crash over me again.

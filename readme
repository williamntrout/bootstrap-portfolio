Bootstrap Portfolio

Purpose:
    Deliverable should demonstate a particular level of profiency using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap principals.  
    Deliverable should should meet the paramters of the assignment given.

Criteria Given:
    Deliverable must contain an index.html file, a Portfolio.html file, and contact.html file.
    These files will be built in such a way to be a reasonable version of the example given. i.e. containing all funtional elements.
    Layout must contain a navbar, sticky footer, be responsive (mobile compatible), and contian responive images.
    Deliverable should be funtional (i.e. all links work, navebar is consistant across all pages, must contain personal bio information.)

Summation:

    Using the skills demonstrated the first two weeks of teh program, I did my best to replicate (as close as I though necessary) the assignement examples given.  I used Bootstrap as much as possible to create the navbar, picture cards, buttons, and content fields.

    I insured that my content will collapse and reformat clearly when going down to smaller screen sizes. All element wrap and stack and remain visabel and usable.  I insured there are no elements that ovelay eachother making them unsuable or not visable to the user. 

    I spent an equal amount of time goign over the code to insure there was use of semantic language and that the layout made sense along with the the tags being logical. I also tried to minimize as much non necessary lines as I could identify.

Submission standard:
